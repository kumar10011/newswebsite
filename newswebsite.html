            <h2>Today Is “National Popcorn Day”</h2>
            <p> National Popcorn Day is a celebration that pays homage to the beloved and timeless snack, popcorn. To delve into the history of this special day, one must first explore the origins of popcorn itself. The story of popcorn begins with the cultivation and development of corn. The original corn was derived from a small grass with kernels not vastly different from those of wheat.Over time, careful selection and generations of breeding transformed the corn plant into the variety we are familiar with today. When settlers arrived in the New World from their Old Country, they encountered this remarkable crop, which had been in use for quite some time.National Popcorn Day is a time to celebrate the rich history and irresistible appeal of this snack that has been cherished for generations. Whether enjoyed at the movies, during game nights, or as a daily indulgence, popcorn continues to be a popular and timeless treat.

            <h2>"I'm uncomfortable...": Elon Musk On Why He Wants Greater Control of Tesla</h2>
            <p> The Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk, said he would be uncomfortable growing the automaker to be a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics without having at least 25% voting control of the company, nearly double his current stake.

                Musk said on Monday in a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, that unless he got stock in the world’s most valuable automaker that was “enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned”, at Tesla, he would prefer to build products outside of the electric-vehicle manufacturer.
                
                He has long touted Tesla’s partially automated “full self-driving” software and its prototype humanoid robots but the electric-vehicle maker generates most of its revenue from its automotive business.

            <h2>New York City's best rooftop bars</h2>
            <p>There's something about being far above the hubbub of the Big Apple's streets, especially in the summertime, when humidity levels soar and the concrete feels like it's emanating heat waves.
            "Being on a New York City rooftop gives you this special pleasure of feeling part of the city, inside it, but at a distance," says Ray Chung, director of design at The Johnson Studio, the firm behind the rooftop lounge at The Wit Hotel in Chicago, among other projects."Walking down the streets is one thing, but being able to let your guard down and see the city reduced in size -- all the while still breathing the same air and still hearing the buzz of the city -- it can be intoxicating," says Chung.</p>

            <h2>Kenya Is Now Visa Free For Indian Travellers </h2>
            <p>The East African country of Kenya has always been a bucket list destination for many wildlife and culture lovers across the planet. Home to the magnificent Maasai Mara Reserve, famous the world over for its annual wildebeest migrations and its population of lions, rhinos and elephants, it also hosts Amboseli National Park with its stunning views of Mount Kilimanjaro. Its landscape includes the savannah grasslands, lakelands, mountain highlands and the Great Rift Valley as well as bustling cities such as the capital Nairobi. Tourism is a major contributor to the Kenyan economy.  


                The entry process is now streamlined through a newly-developed digital platform,  which will issue an electronic travel authorisation, eliminating the visa process. 
                
                
                The new initiative is in keeping with President Ruto’s advocacy for visa-free travel within the continent of Africa, in an effort to strengthen ties between the nations.

            <h2>The best things to do and see in Newport</h2>
            <p> Many of those cliches about postcard-pretty coastal New England towns got their start in the same place: Newport, Rhode Island.The town is best known for being a summer getaway for America's aristocracy during the Gilded Age, with wealthy families like the Vanderbilts, the Dukes and Astors all owning summer homes there (they say "cottage," we say "ginormous mansion") and throwing glamorous parties.Although more of the luxurious estates are museums than homes these days, Newport hasn't lost its seaside charm -- especially in the summer. Here's our guide to the best things to do, eat and explore both indoors and out.</p>

            <h2>Dogs wag their tail to convey a lot more than just happiness, study finds </h2>
            <p>The study suggests that when dogs experience a positive emotion, they tend to wag their tail more towards the right. However, their wagging inclines towards the left more when they have a negative emotion.

                The authors stated that wagging and arousal-related hormones or neurotransmitters might be linked in the dogs' bodies. They also mentioned that there might be a connection between the stress hormone cortisol and tail wagging.  </p>
